          as to whether the shift graph on Baire space is minimal among graphs of
          indecomposably infinite Borel chromatic number. To do so, we use ergodic-theoretic
          techniques to construct a new graph amalgamating various properties of the shift
          actions of free groups. The resulting graph is incomparable with any graph induced
          by a function. We then generalize this construction and collect some of its useful
          properties.

          In Chapter I, we study algebraic properties of full groups of automorphisms of
          &sigma;-complete Boolean algebras. We consider problems of writing automorphisms as
          compositions of periodic automorphisms and commutators (generalizing work of Fathi
          and Ryzhikov), as well as problems concerning the connection between normal subgroups
          of a full group and ideals on the underlying algebra, in the process giving a new proof
          (joint with David Fremlin) of Shortt's characterization of the normal subgroups of the
          group of Borel automorphisms of an uncountable Polish space, as well as a characterization
          of the normal subgroups of full groups of countable Borel equivalence relations which are
          closed in the uniform topology of Bezuglyi&ndash;Dooley&ndash;Kwiatkowski. We also
          characterize the existence of an E-invariant Borel probability measure in terms of a
          purely algebraic property of [E]. The results of Chapter II include classifications of
          Borel automorphisms and Borel forests of lines up to the descriptive analog of Kakutani
          equivalence, along with applications to the study of Borel marriage problems, generalizing
          and strengthening results of Shelah&ndash;Weiss, Dougherty&ndash;Jackson&ndash;Kechris,
          and K&lstrok;opotowski&ndash;Nadkarni&ndash;Sarbadhikari&ndash;Srivastava. We also study the sorts
          of full groups on quotients of the form X/E for which the results of Chapter I do not apply.
          Actions of such groups satisfy a measureless ergodicity property which we exploit to obtain
          various classification and rigidity results. In particular, we obtain descriptive analogs of
          some results of Connes&ndash;Krieger and Feldman&ndash;Sutherland&ndash;Zimmer, answering
          a question of Bezuglyi. In Chapter III, we study some descriptive properties of quasi-invariant
          measures. We prove a general selection theorem, and use this to show a descriptive set-theoretic
          strengthening of an analog of the Hurewicz ergodic theorem which holds for all countable Borel
          equivalence relations. This then leads to new proofs of Ditzen‚Äôs quasi-invariant ergodic
          decomposition theorem and Nadkarni‚Äôs characterization of the existence of an E-invariant
          probability measure, and also gives rise to a quasi-invariant version of Nadkarni‚Äôs theorem,
          as well as a version for countable-to-one Borel functions. We close chapter III with results on
          graphings of countable Borel equivalence relations, strengthening theorems of Adams and Paulin.

          The goal of these notes is to provide a succinct introduction to the
          primary structural dichotomy theorems of descriptive set theory. The
          only prerequisites are a rudimentary knowledge of point-set topology
          and set theory. Working in the base theory ZF + DC, we first discuss
          trees, the corresponding representations of closed, Borel, and Souslin
          sets, and Baire category. We then consider consequences of the open
          dihypergraph dichotomy and variants of the &Gopf;<sub>0</sub>
          dichotomy. While primarily focused upon Borel structures, we also note
          that minimal modifications of our arguments can be combined with
          well-known structural consequences of determinacy (which we take as a
          black box) to yield generalizations into the projective hierarchy and
          beyond.

        <div class="abstract">
          We use edge slidings and saturated disjoint Borel families to give a streamlined proof of
          Hjorth's theorem on cost attained: If a countable p.m.p. ergodic equivalence relation E is
          treeable and has cost n &in; &Nopf; &Union; {&infin;} then it is induced by an a.e. free
          p.m.p. action of the free group on n generators. More importantly, our techniques give a
          significant strengthening of this theorem: the action can be arranged so that each of the n
          generators alone acts ergodically. The existence of an ergodic action for the first generator
          immediately follows from a powerful theorem of Tucker&ndash;Drob, whose proof however uses a
          recent substantial result in probability theory as a black box. We give a constructive and
          purely descriptive set theoretic proof of a weaker version of Tucker&ndash;Drob's theorem,
          which is enough for many of its applications, including our strengthening of Hjorth's
          theorem. Our proof uses new tools, such as asymptotic means on graphs, packed disjoint Borel
          families, and a cost threshold for finitizing the connected components of nonhyperfinite
          graphs.

          We study the Borel structure of quotient spaces of the form X/E, where X is a Polish space
          and E is a countable Borel equivalence relation on X. Our main result is the classification
          of finite Borel equivalence relations on the non-smooth hyperfinite quotient space
          2<sup>&Nopf;</sup>/&Eopf;<sub>0</sub>. In particular, we see that for each natural number n &in;
          &Nopf;, there are only finitely many Borel equivalence relations on
          2<sup>&Nopf;</sup>/&Eopf;<sub>0</sub> whose classes are all of cardinality n, up to Borel isomorphism.
          We achieve our main result by classifying Borel cocycles from hyperfinite equivalence
          relations into finite groups, up to Borel reducibility. This, in turn, depends on a
