            We use edge slidings and saturated disjoint Borel families to give a streamlined proof of
            Hjorth's theorem on cost attained: If a countable p.m.p. ergodic equivalence relation E is
            treeable and has cost n &in; &Nopf; &Union; {&infin;} then it is induced by an a.e. free
            p.m.p. action of the free group on n generators. More importantly, our techniques give a
            significant strengthening of this theorem: the action can be arranged so that each of the n
            generators alone acts ergodically. The existence of an ergodic action for the first generator
            immediately follows from a powerful theorem of Tucker&ndash;Drob, whose proof however uses a
            recent substantial result in probability theory as a black box. We give a constructive and
            purely descriptive set theoretic proof of a weaker version of Tucker&ndash;Drob's theorem,
            which is enough for many of its applications, including our strengthening of Hjorth's
            theorem. Our proof uses new tools, such as asymptotic means on graphs, packed disjoint Borel
            families, and a cost threshold for finitizing the connected components of nonhyperfinite
            graphs.
