            In Chapter I, we study algebraic properties of full groups of automorphisms of
            &sigma;-complete Boolean algebras. We consider problems of writing automorphisms as
            compositions of periodic automorphisms and commutators (generalizing work of Fathi
            and Ryzhikov), as well as problems concerning the connection between normal subgroups
            of a full group and ideals on the underlying algebra, in the process giving a new proof
            (joint with David Fremlin) of Shortt's characterization of the normal subgroups of the
            group of Borel automorphisms of an uncountable Polish space, as well as a characterization
            of the normal subgroups of full groups of countable Borel equivalence relations which are
            closed in the uniform topology of Bezuglyi&ndash;Dooley&ndash;Kwiatkowski. We also
            characterize the existence of an E-invariant Borel probability measure in terms of a
            purely algebraic property of [E]. The results of Chapter II include classifications of
            Borel automorphisms and Borel forests of lines up to the descriptive analog of Kakutani
            equivalence, along with applications to the study of Borel marriage problems, generalizing
            and strengthening results of Shelah&ndash;Weiss, Dougherty&ndash;Jackson&ndash;Kechris,
            and K&lstrok;opotowski&ndash;Nadkarni&ndash;Sarbadhikari&ndash;Srivastava. We also study the sorts
            of full groups on quotients of the form X/E for which the results of Chapter I do not apply.
            Actions of such groups satisfy a measureless ergodicity property which we exploit to obtain
            various classification and rigidity results. In particular, we obtain descriptive analogs of
            some results of Connes&ndash;Krieger and Feldman&ndash;Sutherland&ndash;Zimmer, answering
            a question of Bezuglyi. In Chapter III, we study some descriptive properties of quasi-invariant
            measures. We prove a general selection theorem, and use this to show a descriptive set-theoretic
            strengthening of an analog of the Hurewicz ergodic theorem which holds for all countable Borel
            equivalence relations. This then leads to new proofs of Ditzen’s quasi-invariant ergodic
            decomposition theorem and Nadkarni’s characterization of the existence of an E-invariant
            probability measure, and also gives rise to a quasi-invariant version of Nadkarni’s theorem,
            as well as a version for countable-to-one Borel functions. We close chapter III with results on
            graphings of countable Borel equivalence relations, strengthening theorems of Adams and Paulin.

            This volume provides a self-contained introduction to some topics in orbit
            equivalence theory, a branch of ergodic theory. The first two chapters focus
            on hyperfiniteness and amenability. Included here are proofs of Dye's theorem
            that probability measure-preserving, ergodic actions of the integers are orbit
            equivalent and of the theorem of Connes&ndash;Feldman&ndash;Weiss identifying amenability
            and hyperfiniteness for non-singular equivalence relations. The presentation
            here is often influenced by descriptive set theory, and Borel and generic analogs
            of various results are discussed. The final chapter is a detailed account of
            Gaboriau's recent results on the theory of costs for equivalence relations and
            groups and its applications to proving rigidity theorems for actions of free groups.
