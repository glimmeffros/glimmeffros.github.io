            We give first-order properties of the full group of an aperiodic countable Borel equivalence
            relation that characterize the existence of an invariant probability measure.

            We introduce essential values of Borel cocycles from analytic equivalence relations to
            countable discrete groups, establish a Glimm&ndash;Effros-style characterization of the
            circumstances under which such cocycles have a given non-trivial essential value, and
            obtain a Dougherty&ndash;Jackson&ndash;Kechris-style embedding theorem for such cocyles with
            hyperfinite domains. We then use these results to classify suitably Borel finite equivalence
            relations and free actions of finite groups on &Ropf;/&Qopf;. Assuming that
            (&Zopf;&lowast;&Zopf;)-orderable Borel equivalence relations are hyperfinite, we also show that
            every suitably Borel automorphism of &Ropf;/&Qopf;; is both a product of three
            involutions and a commutator, and that the group of all such automorphisms has exactly four
            proper normal subgroups and the 12-Bergman property.

            We introduce a notion of separability that holds of all Borel automorphisms of standard
            Borel spaces and automorphisms of complete Boolean algebras. We then prove that separable
            automorphisms of &sigma;-complete Boolean algebras are products of various types of periodic
            automorphisms in their full groups. As applications, we show that a wide variety of groups
            of automorphisms consist solely of commutators and satisfy the Bergman property, that
            natural strengthenings of the Bergman property characterize the inexistence of invariant
            Borel probability measures in standard Borel spaces and standard measure spaces, and that
            the length four normal closure of any Borel automorphism of &Ropf;; with uncountable
            support is the group of all Borel automorphisms of &Ropf;.

            We establish a dichotomy characterizing the class of (E &times; &Delta;(Y))-invariant Borel
            sets R &sube; X &times; Y, whose vertical sections are countable, that admit (E Ã—
            &Delta;(Y))-invariant Borel uniformizations, where X and Y are Polish spaces and E is a Borel
            equivalence relation on X. We achieve this by establishing a dichotomy characterizing the
            class of Borel equivalence relations F &sube; E, where F has countable index below E and
            satisfies an additional technical definability condition, for which there is a Borel set
            intersecting each E-class in a non-empty finite union of F-classes.
